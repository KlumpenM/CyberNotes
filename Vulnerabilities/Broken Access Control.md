# What is it
Access control is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized to perform action or access resources. In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management:
**Authentication**: confirms that the user is who they say they are.
**Session management**: identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
**Access control**: determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.
Broken access controls are common and often present a critical security vulnerability. Design and management of access control is a complex and dynamic problem that applies business, organizational and legal constrains to a technical implementation. 
More of less it getting access to things that we shouldn't be able to get access to.
