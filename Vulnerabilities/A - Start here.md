This is how the different files for vulnerabilities are going to be build up, or formatted so that every file looks the same:

**Title of vulnerability**
**What is it**
**How do we do it**
**Tools to use**
**Mitigations (maybe)**

All of the sections are changing, and can be switched out at any time or sections getting added.
