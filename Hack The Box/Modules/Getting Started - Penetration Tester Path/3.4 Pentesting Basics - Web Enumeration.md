# Web Enumeration

## Overview
- Web servers often run on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- Web applications provide a significant attack surface.
- Proper enumeration reveals hidden files, directories, subdomains, and vulnerabilities.

---

## Gobuster
- **Definition**: A tool for brute-forcing directories, files, DNS subdomains, and more.

### Directory Enumeration
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```
- **Results**:
  - Status codes (e.g., 200 = success, 403 = forbidden, 301 = redirect).
  - Identifies hidden directories or files (e.g., `/wordpress`).

### DNS Subdomain Enumeration
```bash
gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt
```
- Reveals subdomains (e.g., `blog.inlanefreight.com`).

## Banner Grabbing and Server Headers
- **Tools**:
  1. **cURL**: Retrieve headers from a web server.
     ```bash
     curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com
     ```
  2. **EyeWitness**: Take screenshots and fingerprint web applications.

---

## Whatweb
- **Definition**: Extracts version and framework information from web servers.
- **Usage**:
  - Single Target:
    ```bash
    whatweb 10.10.10.121
    ```
  - Multiple Targets:
    ```bash
    whatweb --no-errors 10.10.10.0/24
    ```

---

## SSL/TLS Certificates
- Browsing to an HTTPS site may reveal certificate details such as:
  - **Email addresses**.
  - **Company names**.
  - **Domains**.
- Useful for reconnaissance or phishing attacks.

---

## Robots.txt
- **Purpose**: Instruct search engines on accessible resources.
- **Example**:
  - `Disallow: /private` in robots.txt could indicate hidden pages (e.g., `http://10.10.10.121/private`).

---

## Source Code
- Check web page source code for:
  - **Comments**: May contain credentials or hints.
  - **Hidden fields**: Reveal sensitive information.

---

## Summary
- Tools like Gobuster, Whatweb, and cURL simplify web enumeration.
- Always check for hidden directories, subdomains, certificates, robots.txt, and source code for potential vulnerabilities.

# Questions

1) Try running some of the web enumeration techniques you learned in this section on the server above, and use the info you get to get the flag.
This can be done many ways, but the easiest is just to access the website, go to `robots.txt` see that we have a "admin login page", that we can access. 
Then we access that, and look at the source code `CTRL + U`, and we can see that there is credentials in the code, that hasn't been removed: `admin:password123`, which leads us to a website with the flag: **HTB{w3b_3num3r4710n_r3v34l5_53cr375}**
