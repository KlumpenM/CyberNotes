# Common Terms and Technologies in Penetration Testing

## What is a Shell?
- **Definition**: A program that takes input via the keyboard and passes commands to the operating system.
- **Common Shells**:
  - Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
  - Zsh, Tcsh, Ksh, Fish shell
- **"Getting a Shell"**:
  - Gaining shell-level access to a target system through exploitation.
  - Shell Types:
    1. **Reverse Shell**: Connects back to a listener on the attack box.
    2. **Bind Shell**: Binds to a specific port on the target, waiting for a connection.
    3. **Web Shell**: Executes OS commands via a web browser.

## What is a Port?
- **Definition**: Virtual points for network connections managed by the OS.
- **Port Categories**:
  1. **TCP**: Connection-oriented; requires a handshake.
  2. **UDP**: Connectionless; faster but less reliable.
- **Common Ports**:
  - **20/21 (TCP)**: FTP
  - **22 (TCP)**: SSH
  - **23 (TCP)**: Telnet
  - **25 (TCP)**: SMTP
  - **80 (TCP)**: HTTP
  - **161 (TCP/UDP)**: SNMP
  - **389 (TCP/UDP)**: LDAP
  - **443 (TCP)**: SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
  - **445 (TCP)**: SMB
  - **3389 (TCP)**: RDP

### Importance
- Essential to recognize port numbers and their associated protocols.
- Guides like Nmap's top 1,000 TCP/UDP ports are great learning resources.

## What is a Web Server?
- **Definition**: Back-end application managing HTTP traffic and connecting clients to web applications.
- **Typical Ports**: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Exposed attack surface due to public interaction.
  - Often targeted by attackers and pentesters.

## OWASP Top 10
A standardized list of the most dangerous web application vulnerabilities:
1. **Broken Access Control**: Improper restrictions allowing unauthorized access.
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Issues exposing sensitive data or causing system compromise.
3. **Injection**: Unvalidated user data leads to vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL, command, LDAP injection).
4. **Insecure Design**: Applications not designed with security in mind.
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Insecure default configurations, verbose error messages, etc.
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Usage of unsupported or outdated components.
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Attacks targeting identity and session management.
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Dependency on untrusted plugins, libraries, or CDNs.
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Lack of logging/monitoring to detect and respond to breaches.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Exploitation of unvalidated user-supplied URLs.

### Recommendations
- Familiarize yourself with these categories and their associated vulnerabilities.
- Explore the **Introduction to Web Applications** module for deeper insights.

## Summary
- Understanding shells, ports, web servers, and common vulnerabilities is foundational in penetration testing.
- Practice and repetition will make recognition and application second nature.
