# Common Pitfalls

## VPN Issues
1. **Checking VPN Connection:**
   - Look for "Initialization Sequence Completed" in OpenVPN output.
   - Verify tun0 adapter IP using:
     ```bash
     ip -4 a show tun0
     ```
   - Check routing table with:
     ```bash
     sudo netstat -rn
     ```
   - Confirm connectivity by pinging the gateway:
     ```bash
     ping -c 4 10.10.14.1
     ```

2. **Single Device Connection:**
   - HTB VPN only supports one active connection per account. Disconnect from other devices before switching.

3. **Region Selection:**
   - Connect to the closest VPN region for reduced latency. Change server via the HackTheBox platform.

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Refer to [HTB Help Page](https://app.hackthebox.eu/home) for VPN troubleshooting.

## Burp Suite Proxy Issues
1. **Forgetting to Disable Proxy:**
   - Ensure the proxy is disabled after use (via Foxy Proxy or browser settings).

2. **Intercepting Traffic:**
   - If the browser isn't loading pages, check if Burp Proxy is intercepting requests.

## SSH Key and Password Management
1. **Regenerating SSH Keys:**
   - Use `ssh-keygen` to generate new keys:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen
     ```
   - Save keys in the default `.ssh` directory or specify a custom path.

2. **Key Encryption:**
   - Optionally encrypt the SSH key with a passphrase for added security.

## Key Learnings
1. **Connection Checks:** Regularly verify VPN and proxy settings to avoid connectivity issues.
2. **Device Management:** Ensure only one device connects to the VPN at a time.
3. **Tool Configuration:** Manage tools like Burp Suite to prevent unintended network disruptions.
