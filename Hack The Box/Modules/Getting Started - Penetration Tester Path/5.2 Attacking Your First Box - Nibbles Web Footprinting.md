# Nibbles - Web Footprinting

## Tools and Techniques Used
1. **WhatWeb:**
   - Command: `whatweb 10.129.42.190`
   - Identified technologies: Apache 2.4.18, Ubuntu Linux, HTML5, JQuery, Nibbleblog (PHP blogging engine).

2. **cURL:**
   - Discovered HTML comments revealing the `/nibbleblog/` directory.

3. **Gobuster Directory Enumeration:**
   - Command: `gobuster dir -u http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/ --wordlist /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`
   - Found directories/pages:
     - `/admin` (redirects)
     - `/admin.php` (200 status)
     - `/content` (directory listing enabled)
     - `/README` (200 status)
     - `/themes`, `/plugins`, `/languages` (accessible directories).

4. **XML Analysis with cURL and xmllint:**
   - Extracted user information from `users.xml` confirming the username as `admin`.
   - Checked `config.xml` for additional hints.

## Findings
1. **Technologies Identified:**
   - Apache Web Server (2.4.18)
   - Nibbleblog v4.0.3 (confirmed via `README` file).
   - HTML5, JQuery, PHP.

2. **Admin Portal:**
   - URL: `http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/admin.php`.
   - Login attempts protected by IP blacklist after multiple failed attempts.

3. **Directory Listing:**
   - Accessible directories provided insights, such as a valid username (`admin`) from `users.xml`.
   - Directories like `themes` and `content` revealed additional resources.

4. **Credentials Discovery:**
   - Password guessed as `nibbles` based on clues (box name, email hints, and other observations).

## Exploit Potential
- **Vulnerability Identified:** Authenticated file upload vulnerability for Nibbleblog v4.0.3.
- **Requirements:**
  - Admin credentials (`admin:nibbles` discovered).
  - Exploit details available via Metasploit module (targets `/admin.php`).

## Key Learnings
- **Iterative Enumeration:** Layered recon methods unveiled critical insights (e.g., valid username, admin panel).
- **Importance of Context:** Analyzing directory contents and comments revealed sensitive information.
- **Effective Use of Tools:** Combined use of Gobuster, WhatWeb, cURL, and manual browsing proved invaluable.

## Summary Process
1. Identified web technologies and directories using WhatWeb and Gobuster.
2. Gathered user data and credentials through XML files and careful observation.
3. Explored admin portal with discovered credentials to confirm access and vulnerability potential.
4. Enumerated configurations and confirmed the presence of an exploitable service (Nibbleblog).
