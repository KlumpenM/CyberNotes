# Staying Organized in Information Security

## Importance of Organization
- Essential for client assessments, CTFs, labs, and coursework.
- Prioritize clear and accurate documentation.
- Benefits apply across career paths, not just information security.

---

## Folder Structure for Assessments
- Organize data such as:
  - Scoping information
  - Enumeration data
  - Evidence of exploitation (e.g., credentials, screenshots)
  - Recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation data

### Sample Folder Structure
```plaintext
Projects/
└── Acme Company
    ├── EPT
    │   ├── evidence
    │   │   ├── credentials
    │   │   ├── data
    │   │   └── screenshots
    │   ├── logs
    │   ├── scans
    │   ├── scope
    │   └── tools
    └── IPT
        ├── evidence
        │   ├── credentials
        │   ├── data
        │   └── screenshots
        ├── logs
        ├── scans
        ├── scope
        └── tools
```
- Experiment to find what works best for you.
- Example approaches:
  - Folder per target host.
  - Organize screenshots by host or network.
  - Save screenshots directly in note-taking tools.
