# Understanding Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

## What is a VPN?
- **Definition**: A secured communication channel over public networks to connect to private networks.
- **Functionality**:
  - Routes a device's internet connection through the target VPN's private server.
  - Appears to originate from a public IP other than our own.

### Types of Remote Access VPNs
1. **SSL VPN**:
   - Uses a web browser as the VPN client.
   - Access web-based apps or internal networks without specialized software.
2. **Client-Based VPN**:
   - Requires software to establish the VPN connection.
   - Mimics direct connection to the network for full access to resources.

## Why Use a VPN?
- **Privacy and Security**:
  - Obscures browsing traffic and disguises the public IP address.
  - Protects data on hostile networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
- **Limitations**:
  - VPN providers may log data, reducing privacy.
  - Does not guarantee anonymity or protection from illegal activity consequences.

## Connecting to HTB VPN
- Purpose: Access private lab networks with vulnerable VMs.
- **Considerations**:
  - Treat the network as hostile.
  - Use virtual machines only, and secure the attack VM (e.g., disallow SSH password auth).
  - Avoid using the same VM for client assessments and labs.

### Example Command
```bash
sudo openvpn user.ovpn
```
- **Components**:
  - `sudo`: Runs the command with elevated privileges.
  - `openvpn`: VPN client.
  - `user.ovpn`: The VPN key downloaded from the HTB platform.

- **Successful Connection**:
  - Last line reads: `Initialization Sequence Completed`.

### Verifying Connection
1. **Check `ifconfig`**:
    - Look for a `tun` adapter (e.g., `tun0`) indicating VPN connection.
2. **Check Accessible Networks with `netstat -rn`**:
    - Displays networks available via the VPN.

### Example Outputs
**ifconfig**:
```plaintext
tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
    inet 10.10.x.2  netmask 255.255.254.0  destination 10.10.x.2
```
**netstat -rn**:
```plaintext
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
10.129.0.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.0.0     UG        0 0          0 tun0
```

## Summary
- VPNs secure connections and provide controlled access to private networks.
- Essential for penetration testing labs like HTB.
- Always follow security best practices when connecting via VPN.
