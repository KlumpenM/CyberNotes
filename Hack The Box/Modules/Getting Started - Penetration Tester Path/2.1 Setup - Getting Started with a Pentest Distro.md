# Starting a Technical Path in Information Security

## Importance of Familiarity with Technology
- Understand and secure **Linux** and **Windows** attack machines.
- Common setups:
  - Linux/Windows VM on local machines.
  - Base operating system.
  - Cloud Linux boxes.
  - VMs within client environments.
  - Direct testing from client workstations for insider threat simulations.

---

## Choosing a Linux Distro for Penetration Testing
- **Debian-based preloaded distros** are popular.
- Distros include many tools but may not cover all requirements.
- **Customizing distros** is possible as you progress.
- Examples of uses:
  - Penetration testing.
  - Web application testing.
  - Digital forensics.

### Example: Parrot OS
- Used in the **Pwnbox** environment for Hack The Box Academy exercises.
- Fresh installations are essential for assessments to avoid retaining sensitive data.

## Setting Up a Pentest Distro
### Methods
1. **Base OS installation** (not recommended).
2. **Dual boot configuration** (time-consuming).
3. **Virtualization** (preferred):
   - Tools: Hyper-V, VirtualBox, VMware ESXi, VMware Workstation Player (free), VMware Workstation (paid).

### Benefits of Hypervisors
- Create and run **virtual machines (VMs)**.
- Isolation between primary OS and vulnerable networks.
- Examples:
  - Test exploits during assessments.
  - Build lab environments for tool and technique testing.

### Recommended Practice
- **Home Lab Setup**:
  - Reproduce vulnerabilities.
  - Test remediation techniques.
  - Experiment with new attacks and tools.
  - Preferred setup: server with a bare-metal hypervisor.

## Parrot OS and Pwnbox
- Parrot OS serves as the base for **Pwnbox**.
- Formats for installation:
  1. **ISO**: Customizable installation (e.g., keyboard layout, partitioning).
  2. **OVA**: Pre-built and rapid deployment.

### Documentation and Resources
- **Parrot Linux team resources**:
  - What is Parrot?
  - Installation guides.
  - Configuration documentation.
  - Community forums.

### Pwnbox in Hack The Box Academy
- In-browser version of Parrot OS.
- No virtualization software needed.
- Options:
  - Spawn Docker images.
  - Spawn target hosts and download VPN keys for external VM access.
- Use Pwnbox or personal VMs for completing exercises.

---

## Summary
- Technical expertise in virtualization and system setup is vital.
- Learn to effectively deploy, customize, and secure pentest environments.
- Hands-on practice with **Parrot OS** and **Pwnbox** builds familiarity with tools and techniques essential for penetration testing.
