This is going to be a guide walkthrough of the box, split into multiple parts, since this is what HTB does.

## Penetration Testing Types
1. **Black-Box Testing:** Minimal knowledge, focuses on external reconnaissance.
2. **Grey-Box Testing:** Some prior information, simulates an insider attack.
3. **White-Box Testing:** Full access to systems, allows for comprehensive testing.

## Nmap Commands and Outputs
### Initial Nmap Scan
Command:
```
nmap -sV --open -oA nibbles_initial_scan <ip address>
```
Output:
- **Open Ports:**
  - 22/tcp: OpenSSH 7.2p2 (Ubuntu Linux)
  - 80/tcp: Apache httpd (Ubuntu)

### Full TCP Port Scan
Command:
```
nmap -p- --open -oA nibbles_full_tcp_scan <ip address>
```
Purpose: Scans all 65,535 TCP ports.

### Script Scan
Command:
```
nmap -sC -p 22,80 -oA nibbles_script_scan <ip address>
```
Purpose: Uses default scripts to gather additional details.

Output:
- **Port 22 (SSH):**
  - Hostkey types: RSA, ECDSA, ED25519
- **Port 80 (HTTP):**
  - No HTTP title detected.

### HTTP Enumeration
Command:
```
nmap -sV --script=http-enum -oA nibbles_nmap_http_enum <ip address>
```
Output:
- Enumerates common web application directories but did not reveal useful information.

## Tools and Techniques
1. **Nmap Flags:**
   - `-sV`: Service enumeration.
   - `--open`: Show only open ports.
   - `-oA`: Save output in all formats (XML, Greppable, and Text).
   - `-p-`: Scan all TCP ports.
   - `-sC`: Run default scripts.
2. **Netcat (nc):**
   - Banner grabbing for SSH and HTTP to confirm services.

## Best Practices for Enumeration
- Save scan outputs in multiple formats.
- Keep detailed and timestamped logs for auditing and reporting.
- Use iterative processes to uncover additional information.

# Questions
1) Run an nmap script scan on the target. What is the Apache version running on the server? (answer format: X.X.XX)
This is quite easy, since we are only looking for the service, this can be done with an `nmap` scan:
```bash
nmap -sC <target ip>
```
