## Notes on Host and Port Scanning with Nmap

---

#### **Overview**
- Understanding the tool's functionality is critical to interpreting results.
- Host and port scanning help gather essential details about a system, including:
  - Open ports and their services.
  - Service versions.
  - Information provided by the services.
  - Operating system.

#### **Port States**
| State                | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **open**             | Connection to the scanned port is established (TCP, UDP, SCTP).                  |
| **closed**           | Packet received contains an RST flag, indicating the port is closed.             |
| **filtered**         | No response or error code returned; port state is indeterminate.                 |
| **unfiltered**       | Port is accessible, but state (open/closed) cannot be determined (TCP-ACK scan). |
| **open\|filtered**   | No response; port possibly protected by a firewall or packet filter.             |
| **closed\|filtered** | Occurs during IP ID idle scans; port state is indeterminate.                     |

#### **Scanning Techniques**

##### **1. Discovering Open TCP Ports**
- Default scan (`-sS` SYN scan): Scans top 1000 ports.
- TCP scan (`-sT`): Performed if SYN scan cannot be executed.
- Specify ports:
  - `-p <port>` (e.g., `-p 22,80`).
  - Port range: `-p <start>-<end>`.
  - Top frequent ports: `--top-ports=<number>`.
  - Scan all ports: `-p-`.

---

##### **2. Scanning Top 10 TCP Ports**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10
```
- **Options**:
  - `--top-ports=10`: Scans top 10 most frequent ports.
  - Example output:
    - Open: 22/tcp, 80/tcp, etc.
    - Filtered: 139/tcp, 445/tcp.

---

##### **3. Packet Tracing with Nmap**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping
```
- **Options**:
  - `--packet-trace`: Displays sent/received packets.
  - `-Pn`: Disables ICMP echo requests.
  - `-n`: Disables DNS resolution.
  - `--disable-arp-ping`: Disables ARP ping.
- Example output shows SENT/RCVD packets and their header flags.

---

##### **4. Connect Scan (`-sT`)**
- Full TCP three-way handshake.
- High accuracy but less stealthy (leaves logs).
- Example:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 443 -sT
```

---

#### **Filtered Ports and Firewalls**
- Filtered ports result from dropped or rejected packets.
- Example (filtered port 139):
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn
```

---

#### **Discovering Open UDP Ports**
- UDP scan (`-sU`) is slower than TCP due to the stateless protocol.
- Example:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -sU -F
```

---

#### **Version Scan**
- Identifies service names, versions, and additional details.
- Example:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 445 -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
```

# Questions:
1) Find all TCP ports on your target. Submit the total number of found TCP ports as the answer.
Here we are just using nmap, for this task
```bash
nmap 10.129.177.227 -p- -Pn --disable-arp-ping -n -sS
```
Where the flags are:
- `-p-`: Scan all the ports
- `-Pn`: Disables ICMP Echo requests.
- `-n`: 	Disables DNS resolution.
- `-sS`: SYN scan

2) Enumerate the hostname of your target and submit it as the answer. (case-sensitive)
This can either be done with the `-A` flag or `--script smb-os-discovery`, the latter is way faster than the first one.
We get this output: `nix-nmap-default`
