# Notes on Saving Nmap Scan Results

---

#### **Overview**
- Saving scan results is essential for:
  - Comparing different scanning methods.
  - Examining discrepancies in results.
  - Documentation and reporting.
- Nmap supports saving results in three formats:
  1. **Normal output** (`-oN`): `.nmap` file extension.
  2. **Grepable output** (`-oG`): `.gnmap` file extension.
  3. **XML output** (`-oX`): `.xml` file extension.
- To save results in all formats simultaneously, use the `-oA` option.

---

#### **Example Command**
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target
```
- **Options**:
  - `-p-`: Scans all ports.
  - `-oA target`: Saves results in all formats with the base filename `target`.

#### **Generated Files**
1. **Normal Output (`target.nmap`)**
   ```
   # Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 as: nmap -p- -oA target 10.129.2.28
   Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
   Host is up (0.053s latency).
   Not shown: 4 closed ports
   PORT   STATE SERVICE
   22/tcp open  ssh
   25/tcp open  smtp
   80/tcp open  http
   MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF (Intel Corporate)

   # Nmap done at Tue Jun 16 12:15:03 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.22 seconds
   ```

2. **Grepable Output (`target.gnmap`)**
   ```
   # Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 as: nmap -p- -oA target 10.129.2.28
   Host: 10.129.2.28 ()	Status: Up
   Host: 10.129.2.28 ()	Ports: 22/open/tcp//ssh///, 25/open/tcp//smtp///, 80/open/tcp//http///	Ignored State: closed (4)
   # Nmap done at Tue Jun 16 12:14:53 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.22 seconds
   ```

3. **XML Output (`target.xml`)**
   - XML format provides detailed and structured data suitable for further processing.
   - Example snippet:
   ```xml
   <port protocol="tcp" portid="22">
       <state state="open" reason="syn-ack" reason_ttl="64"/>
       <service name="ssh" method="table" conf="3"/>
   </port>
   ```

#### **Converting XML to HTML**
- Use `xsltproc` to create HTML reports from XML files:
  ```bash
  xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
  ```
- Opening the resulting `target.html` file in a browser shows a clear and structured presentation of the scan results.

# Questions:
1) Perform a full TCP port scan on your target and create an HTML report. Submit the number of the highest port as the answer.
We use the following nmap scan:
```bash
nmap <target ip> -p- -oA target
```
Then we get the format: `.gnmap, .nmap and .xml`, we convert the xml to html:
```
xsltproc target.xml -o tagert.html
```
