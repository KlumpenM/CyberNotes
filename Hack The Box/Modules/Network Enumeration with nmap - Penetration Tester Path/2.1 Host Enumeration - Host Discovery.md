# Notes on Host Discovery with Nmap

---

#### **Overview**
- Host discovery is used to identify which systems on a network are alive and can be tested during a penetration test.
- Nmap provides multiple options for detecting live hosts, the most common being **ICMP echo requests**.

---

#### **Best Practices**
- Always store scan results for:
  - Comparison.
  - Documentation.
  - Reporting.
- Results may vary between tools, making documentation essential.

---

#### **Host Discovery Techniques**

##### **1. Scan a Network Range**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```
- **Options**:
  - `10.129.2.0/24`: Target network range.
  - `-sn`: Disables port scanning.
  - `-oA tnet`: Stores results in all formats starting with the prefix `tnet`.
- **Output**: Displays active hosts in the range.

---

##### **2. Scan from an IP List**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```
- **Options**:
  - `-iL hosts.lst`: Reads IPs from a list (`hosts.lst`).
  - Other options same as above.
- **Example List**:
```plaintext
10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
```
- **Output**: Displays only active hosts from the list.

---

##### **3. Scan Multiple IPs**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```
- Specify multiple IPs or use a range like `10.129.2.18-20`.

---

##### **4. Scan a Single IP**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host
```
- **Options**:
  - `10.129.2.18`: Target IP.
  - `-oA host`: Saves results with prefix `host`.
- **Output**: Confirms if a host is alive, along with its MAC address and latency.

---

##### **5. Use ICMP Echo Requests (`-PE`)**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace
```
- **Options**:
  - `-PE`: Forces ICMP echo requests.
  - `--packet-trace`: Displays all sent and received packets.
- **Output**: Shows ICMP echo and reply details.

---

##### **6. Disable ARP Pings**
Command:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping
```
- **Option**: `--disable-arp-ping`: Ensures Nmap uses ICMP echo requests only.

---

#### **Helpful Add-ons**
- Use `--reason` to understand why Nmap marks a host as alive:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason
```

# Questions:
1) Based on the last result, find out which operating system it belongs to. Submit the name of the operating system as result.
This is the request we are looking for
```shell-session
Tindermeister@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:12 CEST

Host is up (0.086s latency).

```
Gere we see that the Time-to-live, is 128ms on the RCVD request. This is a standard value for **windows**, when it comes to Time-To-Live of the operating system, based on [this](https://packetpushers.net/blog/ip-time-to-live-and-hop-limit-basics/).
