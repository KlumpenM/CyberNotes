### Notes on Introduction to Nmap

---

#### **What is Nmap?**

- **Full Name**: Network Mapper.
- **Type**: Open-source tool.
- **Languages**: Written in C, C++, Python, and Lua.
- **Purpose**:
    - Scans networks and identifies available hosts.
    - Detects services and applications, including names and versions.
    - Determines operating systems and their versions.
    - Evaluates security configurations (packet filters, firewalls, IDS).

---

#### **Use Cases**

- Security auditing for networks.
- Penetration test simulations.
- Verification of firewall and IDS configurations.
- Network mapping and response analysis.
- Open port identification.
- Vulnerability assessments.

#### **Nmap Architecture**

1. **Scanning Techniques**:
    - Host discovery.
    - Port scanning.
    - Service enumeration and detection.
    - Operating System (OS) detection.
    - Scripting Engine for interaction with target services.
2. **Syntax**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `nmap <scan types> <options> <target>`

#### **Scan Techniques**

- **Help Command**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `nmap --help`
    
- **Common Techniques**:
    - **TCP Scans**:
        - `-sS`: TCP SYN scan (default, unless specified otherwise).
        - `-sT`: TCP Connect() scan.
        - `-sA`: TCP ACK scan.
        - `-sW`: TCP Window scan.
        - `-sM`: TCP Maimon scan.
    - **UDP Scan**:
        - `-sU`: Scans UDP ports.
    - **Other Scans**:
        - `-sN`: TCP Null scan.
        - `-sF`: TCP FIN scan.
        - `-sX`: TCP Xmas scan.
        - `--scanflags <flags>`: Custom TCP flags.
        - `-sI <zombie host[:probeport]>`: Idle scan.
        - `-sY`: SCTP INIT scan.
        - `-sZ`: SCTP COOKIE-ECHO scan.
        - `-sO`: IP protocol scan.
        - `-b <FTP relay host>`: FTP bounce scan.

#### **TCP-SYN Scan Example (`-sS`)**

- **Why Popular?**
    - Default method unless otherwise specified.
    - Can scan thousands of ports per second.
- **Process**:
    - Sends a single packet with a SYN flag (avoids completing a full three-way handshake).
    - Results:
        - **SYN-ACK**: Port is open.
        - **RST**: Port is closed.
        - **No Response**: Port is filtered (e.g., dropped by a firewall).

#### **Example Output**

Command:

bash

Copy code

`sudo nmap -sS localhost`

Output:
