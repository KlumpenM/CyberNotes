This is going to be a folder, where I'm having my personal notes, for using Hack the Box, for getting better known with the different modules, paths and machines. 

## Structure
The structure for this note taking system, is going to be with folders describing the overall content, meaning that we are going to be having the following folders:
- Modules
- Machine
Where the module folders is having notes with the module name, and what path it's on (based on what path I took, since modules shows up on multiple paths). So the naming convention for modules is: **module name**-**path**.

For machines folders, this is where there is going to be a mix between machines that I go through myself, and some walkthroughs from the internet or writeups. Since some of the machines gets old or redacted, we are not taking this into consideration, so the naming convention is going to be: **machine name**-**me/write up**.
