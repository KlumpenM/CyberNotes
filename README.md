# CyberNotes
This is a ongoing repo, for my personal notes as I grow in Cybersecurity.

## Format
The format of this notebook, is just going to be personal styles, since I'm start my Obsidian journey with this notebook, so the style may be changing and it gets optimized as I move on.
This notebook is heavily focused on web exploitation, and web app pen testing.

## Tools
All the tools, website, guides, pdf, etc. is going to be linked on the specific note. And I might try to have a dedicated page for the tools and their purpose.
