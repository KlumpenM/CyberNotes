There are five categories of findings, when it comes to a pen test report.
The five categories are:
- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low
- Informational

When it comes to categorising some of the findings, for must vulnerabilities you should start by searching for the vulnerability, it's 99% sure that they already have a score or something that can be a reference point.
Here are some notes for quick look up
### Critical


### High


### Medium


### Low
Server information (version), Header Misconfiguration

### Informational



# Notes for pen testing
When we are doing a pen test, we need to be loud on network/website or the active directory. We want to be loud, because we need to see if this is identifiable in the logs/firewall.
- If we are not loud, how do we know what kind of response the blue team should take?
- What if we missed something in the log, and other script kiddies can do this, then we would like to know that they are scanning our website/network. 
	- If we are not getting them, how can we get a **real** incident.
