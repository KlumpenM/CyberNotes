When it comes to checklists, there are a lot of different checklists.


## Web application checklist
The one thing that we are focussing on right now is the Web application testing, there we are using the "OWASP_WSTG_Checklist".
Which is a comprehensive checklist of what a auditor should go through when pen testing a website.

The checklist can be found [here](https://github.com/tanprathan/OWASP-Testing-Checklist), it's in excel form since this makes the functionality of calculating scores for maturity of a web app much easier
