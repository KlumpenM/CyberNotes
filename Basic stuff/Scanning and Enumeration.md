This builds on top of [[Reconnaissance]], where some of the techniques that we are using in that topic, can be used in the scanning and enumeration.

Tools like (but not limited to):
- Nmap
- Nikto
- OWASP zap
- Burpsuite

We are just looking for information we can gather about the website. The more the better.
The more information that we can get, the easier it is to gain access when it comes to exploiting web apps.

The next step is [[Gaining Access]]
