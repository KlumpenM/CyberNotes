Gaining access it just what you think it is. We are also calling it *Exploitation*.

## Web app
When we are talking about gaining access in web apps, we are typically referring to RCE (Remote Code Execution), if we can leverage a shell that way. 
Even getting access to a user account or admin account.

## Network
When we are talking about gaining access in network pen testing, it typically involves gaining a shell on the target machine.
