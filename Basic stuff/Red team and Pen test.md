There is a difference, when we are talking the different types of assessment that we can be asked to do for a client.
The client is mainly just looking for us to find something vulnerable in their system or website, but we need them to be more clear, since there is a largely difference between these paths:

## Pen testing
Pen testing is the most "buzzy" word in the corporate world, this is where all the high C-level personal thinks that we are looking for vulnerable spots, and using all the things and methodology in our tool box, but this is not the case. 
Pen testing is **very** strict in what is *in scope* and *out of scope*:
- What can we attack? (in scope)
	- Ip address, domains, subdomains
- What can't we attack? (out of scope)
	- Supply chain manufactures? Other business partners
Mostly in a pen testing, we **aren't** allowed to use our whole toolbox, with techniques such as *phishing*, or trying other business partners.

## Red team
Red teaming is more broad than pen testing, this is typically where we are allowed to use the **whole** toolbox, with all the techniques that we have learned such as *phishing*
This is where we are simulating that we are a **APT** (Advance Persistent Threat), so what a adversary normally would do, to do harm to the company, but we are doing it for the good cause. 
One of the best thing that we can use with red teaming, is *phishing*, since a company is only as strong as it's weakest personnel.
