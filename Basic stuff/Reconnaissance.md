Reconnaissance is also what is called **Information Gathering**, and there is two types of reconnaissance:
- Active Reconnaissance
- Passive Reconnaissance
The most important thing for reconnaissance is just to gather information. But what information might we gather, and what information are we looking for.
We are looking

# Active Reconnaissance
Active Reconnaissance is where we are doing things against the website.


# Passive Reconnaissance
Passive reconnaissance is not doing anything *active* with the site that your are pen testing.
This is where you are gathering information about the website on sites like google, LinkedIn, the website, and other sites that might be useful for getting information about the website and the people behind the website.
It's mostly just getting a overview over the public information that's out there.
